## 🔬 Overview  
- **Objective:** Compare and analyze distortion techniques to prevent profile matching attacks.  
- **Techniques Studied:**  
  - Data Perturbation  
  - Noise Addition  
  - Anonymization  
  - Tokenization  
  - Hashing  
  - Suppression  
  - Generalization  

## 📊 Key Findings  
- Anonymization had the highest robustness in preventing profile matching attacks.  
- Noise addition, while useful, had lower robustness due to potential reversibility.  
- Hybrid approaches combining multiple techniques showed promise in increasing privacy without sacrificing utility.
